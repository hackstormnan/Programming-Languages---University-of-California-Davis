I have employed the Programming Language Theory (PLT) language to develop a project focused on implementing algorithms and conducting performance comparisons with various programming languages. By utilizing the PLT language, I have created algorithm implementations that demonstrate the theoretical concepts of programming languages. Furthermore, I have conducted comprehensive performance evaluations, allowing for a detailed analysis of the algorithms' efficiency across different programming languages. This project serves as a testament to my expertise in programming language theory and showcases my ability to evaluate and optimize algorithm performance in a comparative context.
